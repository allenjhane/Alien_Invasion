# Alien_Invasion
## A game in pure Python (including Pygame library)!

### Why I decided to make this game
I made this game when first learning Python. It is a regular alien invasion game that I wish to later on tweak to make it better.

### Problems I encountered
One thing I noticed when making this game was that the more that went into the game the more the game would lag. I first started programming the project on a MacBook Pro for convenience and noticed that the processing system was not able to handle the game after I added all the game object movements. At first, I thought that this was normal but as it gradually got slower and slower and my laptop kept getting louder and hotter, I realized there might be a bottleneck. I then switched my project over to my gaming computer which had a better GPU/CPU and there was little to no lag. This made me realize that even in simple games GPU/CPU matters a lot and should absolutely be considered not only in game dev but in apps that require a lot of processing power.

### How I plan to expand on it in the future
Since this is a simple project that I did when I first wanted to understand Python more, I would like to expand on it sometime in the future. I would like to add different graphics and movements to the game to increase appeal/aesthetics when playing.
